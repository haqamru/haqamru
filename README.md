- 👀 I’m interested in big data, machine learning and explored a little bit on artificial neural network.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and using it in machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project relating to the stock market, or any project involving machine learning as its main mechanics.
